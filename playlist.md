[Dengbej Şakiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Eakiro) Mix
---------------
**Dengbêjî** is a Kurdish music genre sung by Dengbêj. Dengbêjs are singing storytellers. There have been many terms to describe Dengbêjs throughout history, but today Dengbêj is the best known, and also several singing storytellers use Dengbêj as part of their own (artistic) name. Dengbêjs are viewed as a way to transmit the traditions of their Kurdish ancestors in times as it was not possible to publish in Kurdish or about Kurdish history. Since many documents about certain Kurdish events don't exist, today there exist attempts to analyze them through the songs of the Dengbêjs. They sing about Kurdish geography, history, recent events, but also lullabies and love songs.


**Şakir Deniz, also known as Şakiro** (December 25, 1936, Eleşkirt, Ağrı — June 5, 1996, İzmir), was a Kurdish Dengbêj singer.

His songs were often recorded on cassettes and distributed illegally, when the Kurdish language faced limitations in cultural expression in Turkey. He is one of the most prominent figures for Dengbêj in recent times. His and the recordings of other Dengbêjs such as Karapetê Xaço are considered a resource for the ones who also want to become Denbêj singers.
