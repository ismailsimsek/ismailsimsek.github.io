# About me

I'm a Data & Analytics Expert who loves solving complex business problems with data. I've spent years building and implementing end-to-end data solutions, architectures, always with a focus on turning data into meaningful insights. I believe in the power of data to drive real change.

When I'm not absorbed by data, you'll find me exploring art,reading poetry and books, or doing a hike.

You can find my code and open-source contributions on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/ismailsimsek) and within my [GitHub organization](https://github.com/memiiso). For professional networking, please connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ismailsimsek/).
